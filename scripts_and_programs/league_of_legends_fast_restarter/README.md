# League of Legends Fast Restarter

Occasionally I get a bug in League of Legends where none of my hotkeys work. Restarting the game fixes the bug 95% of the time. This script restarts the game efficiently to avoid as much downtime as possible.

## Usage

- Run `ritopls_hotkey_bug_fixer.bat` while in a League of Legends match.

## Notes

- There is no warning or prompts before it kills processes. 

    If you want to add one, you can put `pause` on line 3. This will require you to input a keyboard key after running as confirmation to continue.
