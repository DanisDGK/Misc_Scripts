# Keyboard Layout Translator

Encode and decode text typed on the wrong keyboard layout.

## Usage

- Run `launcher.py`

## Notes

- New layouts can be added by defining a new dictionary and adding a new function in `keyboard_layout_encode_and_decode.py`.

    Then switch out or add on the function calls to `launcher.py`
