# MousePos

Shows the position of the mouse cursor in pixels.

## Usage

- Run `MousePos.exe` and you will see a small window showing your cursor location on the screen

## Notes

- I have no clue where this came from anymore. It wasn't coded by me.

- It can be decompiled easily due to it being so simple.

- I may make my own version at some point.
